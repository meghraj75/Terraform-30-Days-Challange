Day 1 — Terraform Basics: Why Terraform & How It Works


Why Terraform?
Imagine you want to build a house.
You can do it in two ways:

1.Build using hands (manual UI clicks)

“ You pick each brick, each tile → one by one.”
This is the same as going to AWS console, clicking:

Create EC2

Create VPC

Create Subnet

Create Security Group
…etc.

It works, but there are problems:

Problems with manual cloud UI

You may forget one step

Your friend cannot repeat EXACTLY what you did

If it breaks, you can’t rebuild in 1 click

You can’t version control it

You can’t track changes

You can’t copy the same setup to another region or account

Manual work → inconsistent → slow → errors.

2.Build using a blueprint (Infrastructure as Code)
Instead of building by hand, you create a blueprint.

This blueprint says:

I want 1 EC2 machine of type t2.micro

I want this VPC with these subnets

I want this S3 bucket with this name

Now you can simply:

Share the blueprint

Rebuild anytime

Deploy automatically

This is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*.*

So why Terraform when cloud providers already have IaC tools?
All big cloud providers offer their own IaC:

AWS → CloudFormation

Azure → ARM templates / Bicep

GCP → Deployment Manager

So why do people still use Terraform?
Because of one big reason:

Terraform works with ALL clouds
CloudFormation = only AWS
ARM/Bicep = only Azure
GDM = only GCP

But Terraform = AWS + Azure + GCP + Kubernetes + Databases + SaaS tools + Many more.

One tool to manage everything.
Example:
Your company uses AWS + Azure.
Without Terraform → 2 different IaC tools, 2 languages, 2 teams.
With Terraform → one tool, one language (HCL), one workflow.

This is why Terraform became very popular

How Terraform Works Internally
Think of Terraform as a 3-step machine:

Step 1: You write your blueprint (HCL files)
Example:


Copy
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
  bucket = "my-demo-bucket"
}
This is like telling Terraform:
“I want an S3 bucket with this name.”

Step 2: Terraform compares your blueprint with real cloud (Plan step)
Terraform does a comparison:

📘 Your requested state
vs
☁️ Actual cloud state

It shows you what will be created/changed/deleted.

Example output:


Copy
+ aws_s3_bucket.mybucket will be created
This is Terraform saying:
Hey! You want an S3 bucket, but it doesn’t exist.
So I will create it.

Step 3: Terraform makes the changes (Apply step)
Terraform sends API calls to AWS/Azure/GCP.

This is the key point:
Terraform does not create resources by itself.
It only talks to cloud APIs on your behalf.

It tells the cloud:
Please create this bucket.
Please create this EC2 instance.

Cloud responds:
Okay, done.”

A Simple Story

You want to create:
1 EC2 instance

1 Security Group

Without Terraform:
You login to AWS console, click many times.

With Terraform:
You write:


Copy
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

Copy
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name = "web-sg"
}
Then run:


Copy
terraform init 
terraform validate 
terraform plan  
terraform apply
Terraform creates both automatically.

Terraform Commands
1. terraform init
First command you run in any Terraform project

Downloads required providers (AWS, Azure, etc.)

Sets up the .terraform folder

Does not check your code

Does not talk to the cloud

2. terraform validate
Checks if your Terraform code is correct

Catches syntax errors, spelling mistakes, wrong arguments

Works only locally

Does not talk to the cloud

Run this before plan

3. terraform plan
Previews what Terraform will change

Shows create/update/delete actions

Checks your code

Talks to the cloud to compare the real state with your desired state

Safe to run — it does not modify anything

4. terraform apply
Implements the plan

Actually creates/updates/destroys cloud resources

Checks your code

Talks to the cloud

This makes real changes in your environment
